# AI_Music_Note_Finder_And_Tuner
**Goal of the project**

This project is a music note finder and tuner. This uses Clyde A. Lettsome's Musical note detector, and builds upon it. I implements a user prompt asking what note the user is trying to sing or play, and uses a simple rule based AI Algorithim to help determine if the note is sharp or flat in comparison to just finding the note that was played which the original code did. These results are then taken, and the LCD hardware is changed to reflect if the note is flat or sharp, and what the EF(Expected Frequency) is in comparison to the serial monitor which has the approximate frequency.

Original code by Clyde A. Lettsome can be found here:
